Browser always adds some amount of margin/padding to each html element.
Use universal selector to reset page:
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

box-sizing: determines which parts of an element gets included in the size properties of the eleent.
   -content-box (default) does not include border or padding in size calculations
   -border-box DOES include border and padding in size of element

vh = view height. Determines what percent of the view height an element should take up.
For example: { height: 95vh } says take up 95% of the view hight.

background-position: determines where image will be cropped or expanded when window is resized:
for ex: { background-position: top } will crop from bottom when resized.

background-image: use for gradient, if multiple, list using comma, first in list will be the one on top. 
clip-path: specifies shape in which element will still be visible. 
    use polygon function: add coordinates of corners of shape to define shape. Clockwise.

POSITIONING:
*absolute*: position is determined by its parent container which has a position of relative.
using top/right etc. refers to putting the top/left part of the element that amount away from the parent element.
so { top: 50%, right: 50% } will put the top right corner of the element to the center of it's parent's element.

using translate adjusts where the element is in reference to ITSELF.
so { translate: transform(-50%, -50%) } will move the element 50% up and to the left of its current location.


block-level: takes up whole width of occupied space, and create line-break after

ANIMATIONS:
browsers use opacity and transform
@keyframes - define an animation 0-100% is start to end. Define what element looks like at each point in time.

add { animation-name: keyframe-defined-name-whatever, animation-duration: 2s } to the class to be animated

other functions: animation-delay, animation-iteration-count, etc.

psuedo-class - special state of an element. 

treated as text: inline-block, text (obv), span

use transition for psuedoclasses - put property on initial state.
